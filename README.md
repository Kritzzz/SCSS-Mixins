SCSS mixins for CSS3 
====================

About
-----

These are SCSS Mixins I use on a regular basis. I will be updating and tweaking the list with more projects to come. 

Usage
-----

Clone the git repo in your SASS/SCSS project. Use @import to make it available in your files.

    git clone https://github.com/Kritzzz/SCSS-Mixins.git
    
    // scss:
    @import '_mixins';
