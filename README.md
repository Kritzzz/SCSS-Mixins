## SCSS mixins for CSS3 


### About


If you use SCSS on a regular basis, you'll know that mixins are a great thing. So are frameworks like Compass, Bourbon and so on. But sometimes these frameworks are just alot more than you actually need for your project.

These are a couple of SCSS Mixins I use quite often. I will be updating and tweaking the list with more projects to come. 

### Usage


Download the _mixins.scss file or clone the git repo in your SCSS project.

    git clone https://github.com/Kritzzz/SCSS-Mixins.git

Now import the mixins into the file you want to use them in (eg. 'main.scss').

    @import '_mixins';

That's it! :-)
